Database configuration is one of the main parts of a Postxdb setup.
The [database setup|guide:databasesetup] description contains examples of this part of the configuration.
Regardless of database, the following properties are needed:
{code}
dataSource.driverClassName = <fully qualified Java class name>
dataSource.username = orbeonuser
dataSource.password = howdy!howdy
dataSource.url = jdbc:...
dataSource.dbCreate = update
{code}
where @orbeonuser@ is a database user that has database access.
Its privileges must include create table and select/insert/update.
You may freely use a different name for this user, and (of course) some other password.

By default the Postxdb GUI expects Orbeon to run on port 8080 on localhost
according to the property below.
If this is the desired behavior you don't have to include this property.
Modify accordingly if Orbeon does not run on @localhost:8080@.
Set the property to an empty value if you want to avoid linking to Orbeon.
{code}
postxdb.orbeon.urlBase = http://localhost:8080/orbeon/fr
{code}

If you want storage notifications, then add the following configuration entries.
{code}
postxdb.callback.source.port = 25759
postxdb.callback.destination.port = 25758
{code}

This example means that Postxdb uses port 25759 to send notifications.
It will send them to port 25758 on the same host.
You may, of course, pick different port numbers.
It is not possible (nor advisable at this stage) to send notifications to other hosts.

If you want to allow languages to be added to forms from the Postxdb browser,
set the following property.
{code}
postxdb.gui.allowAddLanguage = true
{code}

There is a similar configuration item to allow the REST API to add languages.
It is described among the [Postxdb methods|guide:restpostx] in the API documentation.

h4. Configuration for Building Postxdb

A configuration must be defined if you build Postxdb from source.
You specify the configuration file using an environment variable or system property as [described here|guide:configfile].
The main difference is that you need a separate test database unless you turn off all testing during the build.
Create the database the same way you created the main database, and do not create any tables.
Integration tests assume they run against a completely empty database.

This is how the test database is specified:
If the normal configuration file path is @/some/directory/app-conf.properties@ then add a file in the same directory named
@test-app-conf.properties@, that is, prepend @test@ to the configuration file name.
Postxdb will read the normal configuration first, and then the test configuration.
Any entries in the test configuration override the values in the normal configuration.

For example, if the test database uses the same username and password as the main database, the test configuration
could look like this:
{code}
dataSource.url = jdbc:postgresql://{host}:{port}/{TEST database name}
dataSource.dbCreate = create-drop
{code}

If you prefer, it's perfectly possible to have a completey separate test configuration file and
change the environment variable accordingly.

The ''create-drop'' setting means that database tables will be created automatically and also dropped automatically after tests have completed.

If the test database uses a different username or password, add those properties to the test configuration file. 

If you build Postxdb without a separate test database, data will be written to whatever database is configured.
Tests will fail if you repeat them because they expect a clean database.

A typical build command is @mvn clean install@ (using Maven).
