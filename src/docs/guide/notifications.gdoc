You may configure Postxdb to send notifications of storage events.
This is especially relevant for Form Builder.
It is difficult to know or control programmatically what a user does in Form Builder.
Form Runner, on the other hand, is more flexible when it comes to button configuration.

A Postxdb notification consists of a UDP packet containing a JSON array,
equivalent to a Java/Groovy Map.
Postxdb notifications are asynchronous, meaning that they don't block the operation they are part of.
No response is expected, configuring notifications and then not listening for them does not break anything.
